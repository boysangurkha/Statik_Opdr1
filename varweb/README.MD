# Craft CMS starter package by Statik.be

This a scaffolding package for Craft CMS, by [Statik.be](https://www.statik.be). We use this internally to start new projects.

### Assumptions made

We assume a couple of things

- We use [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com/) for email delivery.

- We use [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for our frontend build.

### üõ† Usage

Use the following command to set up a new project:

```bash

composer create-project statikbe/craft PATH

```

‚û°Ô∏è A Craft CMS project will be created. Next Craft asks to start the set-up:

```bash
